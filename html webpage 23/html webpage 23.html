            <p class="two">Paragraph on Water: Water is the only molecule because of which life is possible on Earth. In outer space, the conditions are so hostile that Water cannot be found in its natural form- liquid. This liquid Water has been giving us sustenance throughout billions of years.</p>
            <p class="three">Water is the most important liquid for all living forms. It is not only necessary for our life processes but is also required for the functioning of our planet. Water is available in 3 states on the Earth- solid, liquid, and gaseous. Solid-state includes glaciers, snow caps, ice sheets, and polar ice reserves. The liquid state includes rivers, seas, lakes, ponds, streams, oceans, and geysers. The gaseous state includes water vapor found in the atmosphere. No matter which state it is in, the composition of Water remains the same throughout. It is a powerful compound that nurtures all the life present on Earth. Plants require water for photosynthesis and respiration. Humans require water for many different life processes like circulation, digestion, respiration, and excretion, without Water, life would be impossible on Earth. As it is such an important compound, we must make sure that we conserve it so that it won’t get exhausted soon.</p>

            <p class="four">1.  Describe:   I am going to DESCRIBE a sunset!

                Sunset is the time of day when our sky meets the outer space solar winds. There are blue, pink, and purple<br> swirls, spinning and twisting, like clouds of balloons caught in a whirlwind. The sun moves slowly to hide <br>behind the line of horizon, while the moon races to take its place in prominence atop the night sky. People<br> slow to a crawl, entranced, fully forgetting the deeds that must still be done. There is a coolness, a calmness<br>, when the sun does set.</p>
                <p class="five">2. Inform:   I am going to INFORM you about the Apollo 11 space mission.    

                    On July 16, 1969, the Apollo 11 spacecraft launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Its mission was <br>to go where no human being had gone before—the moon! The crew consisted of Neil Armstrong, Michael<br> Collins, and Buzz Aldrin. The spacecraft landed on the moon in the Sea of Tranquility, a basaltic flood plain, on<br> July 20, 1969. The moonwalk took place the following day. On July 21, 1969, at precisely 10:56 EDT,<br> Commander Neil Armstrong emerged from the Lunar Module and took his famous first step onto the moon’s<br> surface. He declared, “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.” It was a monumental<br> moment in human history!</p>
